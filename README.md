# Amyloid Motif Sequence Search Tool

A Python-based web app for detecting regions of protein sequences which could form amyloid associations, commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Developed as part of a uni Bioinformatics module which explored the development of methods and software tools for understanding biological data.

* Can be ran offline on local web servers which allow the execution of Python files via CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
* The 'shebang' line at the top of the two '.py' files must point to the system's Python path.
* Both Python files must have sufficient execution privileges (i.e. chmod 755 on linux based servers).
